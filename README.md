# Outer Wilds - Speed up Time
Speed up time in outer wilds!

Ever wanted to make the sun explode FASTER? Today is your lucky day! 
Use numpad keys 0-4 to change the speed at which the universe runs at (although I wouldn't recommend pressing 0)

Also works with the normal number keys

Thanks to Xen and Tllya for the help!

That's it! hope you enjoy :D
